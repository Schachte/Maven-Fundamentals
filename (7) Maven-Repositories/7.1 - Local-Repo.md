# Local Repo

- Where Maven stores everything it downloads
   - Installs in `~/.m2`
   - Directory may differ based on operating system by default

- Stores artifacts using the information provided in the POM (group, artifact, version)

- Avoids duplications by copying it in every project and storing it into local repo


# Repositories

- http accessible location to download files from
- internal and external repositories
- The super Pom.xml provides repositories
- Default location: http://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2
  - Contains all the open-source projects to download
- Multiple repositories are allowed
- You can also have corporate repositories
  - Nexus (Preferred)
  - Artifactory

# Dependency Repository
  - Can contain releases and SNAPSHOTS
  - Can add repositories using <repositories> tag
  - Multiple repositories just require an extra element inside the POM
  - This would be necessary if the JAR you need does not exist on the apache maven repository site (ie closed-source, custom JAR, etc)
  - https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-repositories.html
  - Can specify to only download most recent snapshot OR release in XML

# Plugin Repository
  - Works the same way under a <pluginRepositories> tag in the POM

# Releases/Snapshots
  - Different repositories will handle different types of releases
    - snapshot repo
    - milestone repo
    - RC repo
    - release policies
  - Allows people to understand whether or not they are downloading final release JARs
