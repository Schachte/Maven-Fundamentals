# Goals

Naming conventions MVN uses to execute different build functions within your project.

### Clean
- Deletes the target directory and any generated sources

### Compile
- Compile all source code, generates any files, copies resources to our classes directory

### Package
- Runs the compile command, runs any tests, packages the app based on its packaging type

### Install
- Runs the package command and then install into local repo
- This is the `~/.m2` repository

### Deploy
- Runs the install command then deploys it to the corporate repository
- `Install` will copy it to the local .m2 repository
- DOES NOT deploy to a web server
