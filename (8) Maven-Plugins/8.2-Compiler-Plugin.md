# What is the Compiler Plugin?

- Used to compile code and test code
- Defaults the Java 1.5 (regardless of JDK installed)
- Typically overridden in the POM.xml
  - Add a <configuration> section
  - <form> - spin off on its own thread
  - <maxmem> - specify max memory from system
  - <source>/<target> JDK version override (ie. 1.8)

- The configuration is specific to the plugin, so the tags can vary greatly.
