# Goals

- The default goals are plugins configured in the maven instal
  - clean, compile, test package, install, deploy

- Super pom has these goals defined in it, which are added to your effective POM:

### Example:
```
<plugin>
  <artifactId>maven-clean-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>2.4.1</version>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <id>default-clean</id>
      <phase>clean</phase>
      <goals>
        <goal>clean</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
```

- Goals are always tied to a phase
