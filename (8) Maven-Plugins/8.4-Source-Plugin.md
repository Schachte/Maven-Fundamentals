# What is the Source Plugin?

- Used to attach source code to a jar
- Tied to the package phase
  - Frequently overridden to an install/deploy phase to speed up build
- Use the execution section to define `when` the plugin is going to run
- Adds the source code to the application when deploying
- Nice when debugging because you can step directly into the source code
