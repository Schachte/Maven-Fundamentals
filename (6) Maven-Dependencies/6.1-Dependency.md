# Dependency

- Just list the dependency you want
  - Transitive dependencies will be pulled in by Maven

- Need a minimum of 3 things
  1) groupId
  2) artifactId
  3) version

# Versions

- The release number we want to use
- Development starts off as a `SNAPSHOT`
  - Every time you use a snapshot and compile, the IDE will always look for new code to compile and use
  - `myapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`
  - Saves you from releasing versions for development
  - Never deploy to production with a `SNAPSHOT`
- Use standard semantic versioning for your JARs during release


# Some Naming Conventions
- myapp-1.0-M1
- myapp-RC1
- myapp-RELEASE

# Core Packaing Types
- pom, jar, maven-plugin, ejb, war, ear, rar, par
- Default is jar
- The type `pom` refers to a dependency pom


# Transitive Dependencies

- If you add a dependency it will automatically pull in all dependencies that thing you added requires.
- You add something like `hibernate`.. Well, `hibernate` needs a ton of other JARs as well. Maven will automatically pull these in

# Scopes

- 6 scopes available for dependencies
  - compile - default scope, artifacts available everywhere
  - provided - similar to compile means that the artifact is going to be provided where it is deployed
  - runtime - not needed for compilation but needed for execution
    - drivers that are dynamically loaded (bundling jars)
  - test - Only available for the test compilation and execution phase
  - system - Very brittle (don't ever use this) (hardcoding path to JAR)
  - import - advanced topic (deals with dependency management)

  # Scope Example (test)

  ```
  <dependency>
    <groupId>junit</groupId
    <artifactId>junit<artifactId>
    <version>4.10</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
  </dependency>
  ```

  Only used during test phase, won't be bundled up with the package
